# PNG Payload Exec

Fully automated Python script that creates a PNG image from predefined chunks, encodes it to Base64, and saves both the PNG file and the HTML image tag. The script doesn't require any user input and performs all actions automatically.

On your terminal mingw or linux type the following.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SleepTheGod/PNGPayload
cd PNGPayload
chmod +x main.py
python main.py
```

Example Output
When you run the script, you will see output like

```javascript
PNG image saved as 'payload_image.png'.
HTML image tag saved as 'image_tag.html'.
HTML Image Tag:
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA..." alt="Payload Image">
```
This setup fully automates the process, making it easy to create and use your PNG image and its HTML representation.
